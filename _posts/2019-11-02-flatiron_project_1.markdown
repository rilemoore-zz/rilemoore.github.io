     The first project of my flatiron programming experience was really interesting! As an experienced programmer its always fun and exciting to work with something completely new, and web scraping was something that I have not spent much time with. Its always cool to develop something that has the potential of being useful to someone, even if for a small niche group.

     I knew going into the project that the most difficult part would be setting everything up using the sandbox, and expected much more difficulty with this then I actually encountered. I started off by following the gem creation steps, even though I knew I wouldn't need to create a full fledged gem it seemed like a good starting point for the project. Once I had everything set up, the bulk of the work was simply figuring out what calls I needed to make to get the information I wanted from the website. Finding a good website wasnt too challenging, and I ended up settling on something called serenes forest, which is a really well designed website focused on a series of video games called Fire Emblem (one of my favorites). Scraping information on each game seemed like a good way to go. The only real issue I had is that on 2 of the 23 games, the format was a little different so the scraper messes up in those instances at the moment. 

     Overall I really enjoyed this project for what it was, it was new to me and the potential applications of this knowledge is quite vast and could be useful in some of my future projects I have in mind for myself.
