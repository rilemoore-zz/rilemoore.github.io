After having many holiday celebrations and trips to visit family and friends, I spent this week working on my second Flatiron project, the Sinatra Portfolio Project. Due to travelling, I was a little bit behind on the coursework leading up to the project so the beginning of project week was spent mostly getting refamiliarized with the methods I would use to go about creating this small sinatra project. In addition, I also finally got myself moved over to a local environment, and it has been much smoother working there than with the in browser IDE. I wound up piecing together all of the setup components from labs, only finding out later from Nancy that there was a much simpler and more efficient way to set up everything. At least in doing so I got a bit more familiar with how all of the parts interacted and communicated to each other, which is honestly really helpful for me. 

Coming up with a an actual use for the project took me some time, and I was pitched the idea of an app that would allow a user to keep track of their vehicles, and after market expenses spent on the vehicle. I was going to add in a few more models to store modifications and parts for the vehicles, but as of this moment I havent implemented that just yet. My development process was simple: I went down the line on the specifications file, accomplishing each of the project requriements one by one. I think the biggest hurdle to my coding was just trying to understand how each of the pieces that I had learned from the labs would come together and work correctly and efficiently. Once I got into a rhythm of making updates to my code, testing in the browser, and debugging using the errors received in browser, the project became very enjoyable to work on and steadily improve. 

Most of the tasks required were things we had learned from the labs and study groups, so it was mostly a matter of integrating these components together properly. For input validation I simply used the resources available to active record to perform input validation within each of my models. After protecting data from users who dont own the data, and verifying that the users are inputting values correctly, my project was complete.

I learned a lot in this project, and it is one of the closest things I have done to web development before. It was nice to be able to focus on the functionality of the app rather than the styling, but I do need to learn how to make these web apps look nice and organized soon. Overall I greatly enjoyed the project.
