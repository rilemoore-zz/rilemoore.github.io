The third project of my flatiron experience has definitely been the most difficult so far. Out of all the different frameworks and languages we have worked with throughout flatiron, Ruby on Rails was the most difficult for me to get a decent grasp of. One reason why it might be this way is due to the nature of how much Rails takes care of for the programmer. Some of the ways that routing works, and using generators to get started on projects really felt like magic. However, coming from a C++ background, I am just not quite used to the way it works. Once I got used to controlling the magic of rails, things felt a lot better though.

For this project I wanted to Make a Cinema web app, where a user could create a cinema, the theatres within that cinema, and the movies that were playing in each of those theatres. I wanted to give plenty of ways to navigate the app, so each of these three components has show, index, and edit views, and whenever I reference them they are linked. For example, if I view a cinema, it will show me all of its theatres, and the movies playing at each theatre, with corresponding links to each movie and theatre as well as the option to change what movie a theatre is currently playing. If I view a movie, it will display a list of all cinemas it is currently showing at, with links to the cinema. 

The hardest part of this project was definitely setting up Devise and Omniauth. What seemed like a process that would be as simple as following the steps on a guide ended up taking several days of debugging and tinkering to get everything to work nicely on my Windows setup. 

Though I have achieved the core functionality of my app, I do wish I had some more time to clean up some of the minor bugs within it. The most challenging part of these flatiron apps is knowing how far you can push an idea within the time constraints of both the projects due date and the time available to work on it, so coming to a stop always feels difficult. In the end im happy with the app that I was able to produce and am looking forward to the next one!
